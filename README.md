# E-Commerce Backend (Spring Boot)

This is a simple backend project I’m building to learn **Spring Boot**, **authentication**, and general backend architecture.  
The project will include basic features like user authentication, product management, categories, and secure APIs.

## 🚀 Technologies
- Java 17  
- Spring Boot 3  
- Spring Web  
- Spring Security  
- Spring Data JPA  
- PostgreSQL  
- Maven  

## 📌 Status
The project is currently in the **early setup stage**.  
I’m gradually adding features as I learn new concepts.

## ⚙️ Running the project
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yigittgulbeyaz/ecommerce-backend.git
   ```
2. Configure your PostgreSQL settings inside `application.yml`.
3. Run:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
